# JAVA-Math-Text-Algorithms
Mathematical and textual algorithms that I learned and developed myself.

## About this repository and me
I'm trying to consolidate the structures and algorithms I've learned about Java in this repository with an example that I try to develop in my spare time.

In this project, my aim is to direct users to exist algorithms by asking step-by-step questions, as in old computers.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/serveta/JAVA-Math-Text-Algorithms.git
```

## Usage
After cloning the project, you can open the project in an IDE like Eclipse of your choice.
